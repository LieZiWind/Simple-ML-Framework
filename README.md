# Simple ML Framework
This repo is a simple implementation of some deep learning architectures and statistical learning models, featuring
 - Back-Propagation Algorithm with SGD and Adam optimizer
 - Multilayer Perceptron
 - Various CNN architectures(With the help of PyTorch)
 - Viterbi algorithm used in both Hidden Markov Model(HMM) & Condition Random Field(CRF)
 - Using Transformer's features in the CRF model


This repo also provides some actual use cases, including:
 - Simple function regression by MLP 
 - Classifying Handwritten Chinese Character
 - Named Entity Recognition(NER) on both Chinese and English corpus
